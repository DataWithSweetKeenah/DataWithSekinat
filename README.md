# About Me

Hi, I'm Sekinat Akinde — a Data Analyst with a background in Statistics and a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I enjoy asking the right questions, exploring trends, and using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to drive data-informed decisions.

On this page, you'll find projects that showcase my journey — from analyzing HR data and predicting employee attrition, to working with real-world emergency call datasets and business performance dashboards.

I created DataWithSekinat to document my growth, share my work, and connect with people who believe in the power of data. Whether you're here to explore my projects, collaborate, or just get inspired, you're very welcome.
